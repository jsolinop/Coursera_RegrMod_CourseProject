## Summary 

This document covers the analysis and conclusions about the impact of transmission type (automatic vs manual) in fuel consumption. Specifically, the aim of this document is to answer the next questions:

+ Is an automatic or manual transmission better for fuel consumption?
* Quantify the difference between automatic and manual transmissions, expressed in MPG (miles per galon)


## Car Road Tests

The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

The data is collected in 11 variables in `mtcars` data set. You can see the format of the variables in [Apendix A](# Apendix A). Let's see a summary of the `mtcars`:

```{r cars}
my_cars <- mtcars %>% 
        mutate( mpg = mpg,
                   am = factor(am, labels = c("manual","automatic")),
                   vs = factor(vs, labels = c("V","S")))

summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```
